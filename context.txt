PROJECT DHI – COMPLETE CONTEXT SUMMARY (FOR FUTURE PROMPTS)

NOTE: “Project Dhi” is a working name for an edge-based safety analytics platform. It has previously also been referred to as “Aixavier Edge Analytics” in earlier drafts. The real commercial brand is TBD and should NOT be tied to any specific hardware vendor (e.g., Jetson/Xavier).

ONE-LINER & VISION

Project Dhi is an edge-native, use-case–first video analytics platform that turns existing CCTV cameras into real-time safety agents for high-risk, high-camera-density environments.

We start with US wedge verticals:

Transit / mobility (fleets, depots, rail/bus networks)

Warehousing & logistics (distribution centers, 3PLs, e-commerce hubs)

Over time the same engine extends to:

Stadiums and arenas

Airports and ports

Large retail / malls / big-box formats

Campuses, hospitals, universities

Smart-city public spaces

Core concept:

Cameras and NVRs are already deployed everywhere, but they are mostly used as forensic tools “after the fact”.

Project Dhi sits on the edge, next to those cameras, runs real-time analytics, and detects critical safety and operations events in seconds—not hours.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

Today’s physical safety systems are largely reactive:

Incidents like worker falls, track trespass, vehicle–person conflicts, small fires, crowd surges, assaults or aggression are often noticed late.

Discovery usually happens because someone calls it in, a complaint is made, or a claim hits the system.

Investigation requires manual video review: safety managers or investigators scrub hours of CCTV footage.

Constraints of current approaches:

Cloud-only analytics:

Practical issues: bandwidth limits in fleets, depots, remote yards, industrial sites; cost of streaming 24/7 video.

Policy and privacy: unions, internal policies, regulations often disallow continuous offsite streaming of raw video.

Latency: cloud round-trips are too slow for sub-second detection of critical events like person-down or restricted-zone intrusion.

Built-in NVR/camera analytics:

Very shallow features (motion detection, line-crossing, basic intrusion).

High false-positive rates, little context, difficult to tune.

Poor fit to real safety and operations workflows.

Net result:

The infrastructure (cameras, NVRs, VMS systems) already exists.

But operationally, cameras remain “dumb recorders” instead of proactive safety systems, especially in high-risk sites where a single event can be catastrophic (injuries, deaths, high liability, shutdowns).

SOLUTION OVERVIEW

Project Dhi upgrades existing CCTV systems into live safety assets via an edge-native platform:

Key ideas:

Ingest video from existing infrastructure (RTSP, ONVIF, NVR/VMS outputs).

Run a catalog of safety and operations “patterns” on an edge node:

All heavy compute (ML inference, rule evaluation) runs on-site.

Raw video normally does not leave the customer’s premises.

Generate:

Real-time alerts for operators, safety teams, and automated systems.

Metrics and KPIs (incident rates, detection times, response times).

Audit trails and visual evidence to support compliance and training.

Design principles:

Use-case–first: core IP is the pattern catalog + rules + KPIs + playbooks, not a specific chip or camera.

Hardware-agnostic: runs on multiple edge compute backends.

Edge-native: inference and decision-making close to the cameras, not in a distant cloud.

CANONICAL PATTERN CATALOG (22 USE CASES → 8 PATTERNS)

The system starts from roughly 22 specific safety use cases (originally railway-flavored) and abstracts them into 8 canonical detection patterns that span multiple verticals:

Restricted-Zone Intrusion

Definition: Person or object enters a pre-defined no-go zone.

Examples:

Transit: passenger steps into track area or platform “red zone”.

Warehousing: worker enters forklift-only aisle or behind a reversing truck.

Stadium: fan jumps barrier to pitch or side-stage area.

Airport: individual enters staff-only corridor or airside zone.

Retail/mall: customer walking through a staff-only door.

Person-Down / Fall / Collapse

Definition: Human falls or lies motionless in a concerning posture.

Examples:

Warehouse: worker collapses behind racks or off loading dock.

Transit: passenger collapses on platform or inside bus/train.

Stadium: fan collapses in concourse or seating area corridor.

Retail: shopper falls in an aisle with no immediate witness.

Campus/hospital: patient or staff member collapsed in hallway.

Smoke / Fire / Environmental Anomalies

Definition: Visible smoke, haze, or other environmental cues suggesting fire or hazardous conditions.

Examples:

Warehouse: smoke near battery racks, chemical storage, or racking.

Stadium: concession-stand fire, bin fire under stands.

Airport: small electrical fire in back-of-house storage.

Industrial plant: smoke around equipment or control cabinets.

Aggression / Violence / Fights

Definition: Patterns of motion indicating physical fights or aggressive body language.

Examples:

Transit: altercations in railcars or station concourses.

Stadium: fights among fans in stands or concourse.

Retail: aggressive incidents near checkout or service desks.

Public spaces: fights in outdoor plazas, bus stops.

PPE & Staff Compliance / Presence

Definition: Staff compliance with PPE requirements and presence rules (being in the right place at the right time).

Examples:

Warehouse: worker in restricted zone without hi-vis vest or helmet.

Industrial: missing goggles in a high-risk area.

Transit: staff not present at assigned boarding doors.

Airport/port: staff in unsafe areas without appropriate gear.

Vehicle–Person Conflict & Equipment Misuse

Definition: Vehicles/machines operated outside safe envelopes or near pedestrians in dangerous ways.

Examples:

Logistics: forklifts speeding, turning with elevated loads, or driving where pedestrians are present.

Ports/airports: tugs, yard trucks in areas with ground staff.

Transit: train doors forced open, people hanging out of doors.

Industrial: heavy equipment operating in zones reserved for people.

Crowding, Queues, & Over-Capacity

Definition: Density of people or length of queues exceeds safe or acceptable thresholds.

Examples:

Transit: overcrowded platforms, blocked escalators, long dwell times.

Warehouse: dock congestion, staging area pile-ups affecting throughput and safety.

Stadiums: crowd surges at gates, turnstiles, or concourses.

Retail: excessively long queues in certain departments, blocked aisles.

Airports: congested checkpoints.

Unattended / Suspicious Objects

Definition: Items left unattended for too long in sensitive areas.

Examples:

Transit: baggage left near stairs or platforms.

Stadiums: bags left under seats or in concourse areas.

Warehousing: pallets or boxes blocking emergency exits or fire doors.

Airports: unattended bags in terminal areas.

These patterns map many-to-many with the original 22 use cases. They enable cross-vertical reuse: same pattern, different zones, thresholds, semantics, and playbooks.

PATTERN + RULES + KPIs + PLAYBOOK = IP

The pattern catalog is more than a feature checklist:

For each pattern:

Detection graph:

Which detector models are used.

How they’re combined or sequenced.

Rule templates:

Zone definitions (geofences).

Time-of-day and schedule constraints.

Thresholds (duration, crowd density, etc.).

Severity levels.

KPIs:

Incident rate per 10,000 hours of footage.

Mean time to detect (MTTD).

Mean time to respond (MTTR).

Deployment playbooks:

How to roll the pattern out at a given site type (e.g., large DC, rail platforms, stadium gates).

How to tune thresholds and filters in the first weeks.

How to integrate alerts into existing workflows (control room, radios, ticketing systems).

This combination (pattern + rules + KPIs + playbooks) forms a major part of the defensible IP:

It enables fast vertical expansion without re-implementing everything from scratch.

It standardises deployments and supports system integrators and partners.

ARCHITECTURE & HARDWARE

High-level architecture:

Cameras and NVR/VMS:

Existing IP cameras (various OEMs).

Existing NVRs or VMS platforms (Genetec, Milestone, Avigilon, etc.).

We ingest video via standard protocols (RTSP/ONVIF, mirrored streams from NVR/VMS).

Edge node:

Runs in local rack, control room, back office, or on vehicle.

Hardware options (multi-backend by design):

NVIDIA edge devices (e.g., Xavier/Orin class).

Industrial PCs (x86, with or without GPU).

Future: NVRs or other x86 units that can run our container/agent.

Select smart cameras / ARM SoCs where feasible.

Responsibilities:

Real-time inference on multiple camera streams (target ~4–16 streams/node).

Rule evaluation (zones, schedules, thresholds).

Local buffering and event logging.

Degraded-mode operation when offline.

Control-plane (cloud or central on-prem):

Central configuration:

Zones, patterns, rule templates per site.

Fleet-wide rollout and updates.

Fleet management:

Node registration, health, versioning.

Metrics and analytics:

Aggregated KPIs per site, per pattern, per vertical.

Integration hub:

APIs/webhooks into VMS, incident ticketing, SOC tools.

Role-based access control for operators, safety teams, execs.

Data flows:

Video stays on local networks between cameras and edge nodes.

Edge nodes emit:

Alerts and events (JSON or structured messages).

Anonymised or short video clips (optional, configurable).

Telemetry (CPU, memory, performance metrics).

SECURITY & FIPS DIRECTION

Security posture:

Each edge node is treated as a critical asset:

Secure boot and signed firmware/agent updates where the hardware supports it.

Mutual TLS connections between nodes and control-plane.

Configuration and secrets encrypted at rest.

Defense-in-depth:

Limited attack surface on edge nodes (minimal services).

Strict roles and permissions on control-plane.

Logging and audit trails for configuration changes and access.

FIPS Level 3 direction:

The platform is being designed with FIPS 140-3 Level 3 style expectations in mind, especially for:

Cryptographic modules.

Key storage and handling.

Tamper resistance and tamper evidence in edge deployments.

Objective:

Not FIPS-certified at this moment, but architecture and implementation choices should make it feasible to obtain FIPS-class certifications in the future without major redesign.

This allows serving regulated customers (transit agencies, utilities, critical infrastructure, federal projects) as the company matures.

MARKET & WEDGE VERTICALS (US FOCUS)

Geography:

US-only focus for current modeling and go-to-market.

Wedge verticals (initial 2–3 years):

Transit / Mobility:

Rail, metro, commuter rail, light rail, bus fleets, shuttle services.

Use cases: track trespass, platform crowding, passenger collapse, aggression, suspicious objects, depot safety.

Warehousing & Logistics:

Distribution centers, 3PLs, e-commerce fulfillment hubs, cross-docks.

Use cases: forklift/vehicle safety, dock and yard intrusion, PPE compliance, person-down, fire/smoke near storage.

Expansion verticals (medium term):

Stadiums and arenas.

Airports and ports.

Large retail / mall operators.

Smart-city deployments for public spaces.

Other high-risk industrial and critical infrastructure sites.

Market structure:

Dhi is an “edge safety intelligence layer” that sits next to existing cameras and VMS.

It is not a cloud camera company and not a camera OEM.

Competitors/alternatives:

Traditional VMS + OEM analytics (broad but shallow).

Cloud camera platforms (generic detection, cloud-first).

Vertical safety-AI startups (deep but narrow, often single vertical).

Status quo “do nothing” – manual review, minimal use of analytics.

Differentiation:

Edge-native, privacy- and bandwidth-aware.

Use-case–first pattern catalog, cross-vertical, but anchored in wedge verticals where ROI is very strong.

Designed for industrial and FIPS-grade deployments (security, reliability).

Hardware-agnostic multi-backend architecture.

BUSINESS MODEL & PRICING (WORKING ASSUMPTIONS)

Pricing model (working assumption):

Internal modeling assumption: ~$3,000 per node per year (ARR).

Node ≈ logical edge runtime handling ~4–16 cameras.

Alternative packaging options (to be validated):

Per-site pricing (flat per store / per DC / per depot).

Per-camera pricing (common in cloud camera platforms).

Hybrid models:

Node-based internally mapped to per-site or per-camera externally.

COGS & gross margin (early estimates):

Goal: ~75–80% gross margin at scale.

COGS per node-year (ballpark):

Cloud infra (control-plane, logs, metrics): ~$200–250.

Support and monitoring (Tier 1/2, NOC): ~$300–350.

Tooling, channel enablement, infra amortisation: ~$100–150.

Total: ~$600–750 per node-year.

With $3,000/node-year ARR → gross profit ≈ $2,250–2,400 / node-year (75–80% GM).

These are early estimates to be refined after real pilots.

Revenue scenarios (example, US-only, 5-year horizon, based on previous docs):

Conservative (low case), Base (mid case), Aggressive (high case) node adoption and ARR trajectories.

Not repeated in detail here; can be reconstructed as needed: ARR = nodes × $3k.

For Launchpad application and early grant funding:

A smaller, focused raise of ~$1.2M is assumed:

25% hardware & testing infra.

20% cloud infra & tooling.

26% pilot deployment costs.

12% legal/admin.

18% contingency/buffer.

Objective: bring product from strong demo to production pilots and early multi-site rollouts in US wedge verticals.
